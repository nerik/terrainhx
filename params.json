It then builds a Collada model (.dae) that is usable in most of the 3D packages, as well as in Unity3D or with three.js for example.\r\n\r\n \r\n\tbin/terrainhx <path/to/folder> #this will create the folder\r\n\r\n\t#You will then be asked the following parameters interactively in this order :\r\n\t# Latitude resolution (= number of captures on the y axis, int)\r\n\t# Longitude resolution (= number of captures on the x axis, int) \r\n\t# Start latitude - southernmost (SW) point (float)\r\n\t# Start longitude - westernmost (SW) point (float)\r\n\t# End latitude - northermost (NE) point (float)\r\n\t# End longitude - easternmost (NE) point (float)\r\n        \t\r\n\t#OR\r\n\tbin/terrainhx <path/to/folder> <latRes> <lonRes> <swLat> <swLon> <neLat> <neLon> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Multiple captures\r\nGoogle Maps' elevation service as a daily queries limit. If you need more points than possible in one capture, you can resume a previously started capture :\r\n\r\n\tbin/terrainhx <path/to/folder>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Adding markers\r\n\r\nIt's possible to add markers, the tool will create nodes/pivot points in the 3D model's hierarchy itself :\r\n\r\n\t# --markers <name0>,<lat0>,<lon0>,...<nameN>,<latN>,<lonN>\r\n\tbin/terrainhx <path/to/folder> --markers AltodeGarajonay,28.106692,-17.249,ValleGranRey,28.092136,-17.338584\r\n\r\n\r\nThen get the pivot points like this (with three.js)\r\n\r\n\r\n\tvar markerPivots = colladaMesh.getChildByName(\"markers\").children;\r\n    for (var i= 0; i < 0...markerPivots.length; i++) \r\n    {\r\n        var markerPivot = markerPivots[i];\r\n        //...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Build from source\r\n\r\nTerrainhx is built in Haxe and compiled to Neko.\r\nYou will need mcli and msignal from haxelib, and colladawriterhx (not on haxelib, grab it directly from github : [colladawriterhx][2] )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nBSD 3-Clause License\r\n\r\nAll rights reserved.\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification,\r\nare permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice,\r\n  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\r\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\r\n  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation\r\n  and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\r\n* Neither the name of Terrainhx nor the names of its contributors may be\r\n  used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific\r\n  prior written permission.\r\n\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS\r\n\"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\r\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\r\nA PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
